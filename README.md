# Portfolio project from codecademy

This is a portfolio project from Codecademy which aims to sort and analyse data about U.S. medical insurance costs.

Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn are used to analyse the data.

At the beginning, an overview of the data is given. Afterwards, the first basic evaluations are carried out, which lead into more in-depth analyses.
